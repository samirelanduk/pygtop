About the Guide to PHARMACOLOGY
-------------------------------

The Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (GtoP), originally a collaboration between The British
Pharmacological Society (BPS) and the International Union of Basic and Clinical
Pharmacology (IUPHAR), acts as a “one-stop shop” portal to pharmacological
information. One of its main aims is to provide a searchable database with
quantitative information on drug targets and the prescription medicines and
experimental drugs that act on them.

For more information, see `the website itself

services which pyGtoP accesses can be found `here
