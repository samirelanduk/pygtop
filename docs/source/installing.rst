Installing
----------

pip
~~~

pyGtoP can be installed using pip:

``$ pip3 install pygtop``

pyGtoP is written for Python 3, and as of version 1.0.0 is incompatible with
Python 2. Versions 0.4.1 and earlier will continue to support Python 2.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyGtoP requires the Python librares
`requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`_ and
`molecuPy <http://molecupy.readthedocs.io>`_. These will be installed
automatically if pyGtoP is installed with pip.

Otherwise pyGtoP has no external dependencies, and is pure Python.
