Installing
----------

pip
~~~

pyGtoP can be installed using pip:

``$ pip3 install pygtop``

pyGtoP is written for Python 3, but should be compatible with Python 2.7. To
install for Python 2, use:

``$ pip install pygtop``

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyGtoP requires the Python library
`requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`_. This will be installed
automatically if pyGtoP is installed with pip.

Otherwise pyGtoP has no external dependencies, and is pure Python.
